Significance Assessment of Synergies in the CMT Melanoma Combination Screen

This script allows to reproduce from raw data the statistical analysis for the significance assessment of synergies in the systematic drug screen performed at the MGH Cancer Center. The script is thoroughly commented and is intended to be read and executed on the R prompt. It produces several diagnostic and explainatory figures that are not in the manuscript (because of length restrictions). I hope this document will be useful for several reasons:
* It provides a transparent description of the methods used in the study
* It exposes a novel way of estimating single drugs viability for a better estimation of drug synergy
* It will facilitate follow-up analysis and exploration of the large combination data published with the study

The data is not yet available to the public as the study is under review, before publication, but will be readily available at the time of the publication. 

Reviewers can download the data on the web portal associated with the publication (web link is in the manuscript).

Please feel free to contact me with any request.
